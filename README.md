## Introduction ##

The code in this repository, and other dependency repositories, was ported from Java code found in the separate repository [cdss-app-statemod-java](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-statemod-java), in an effort to determine which programming language would be best suited for converting the StateMod software from Fortran to another language. The initial StateMod code in Fortran was converted to Java by [@Smalers](https://github.com/smalers) at the Open Water Foundation.

The process for porting the code from Java to C# was as follows:

The code was initially converted using a Java to C# auto converter. All of the auto-converted code can be found in each separate repository under the folder `src-autogen-from-java`, however this main repository does not contain this folder since the main repository only contains 3 files. The files in this repository were all converted by hand, but as other classes and methods were needed the code was incrementally copied from the autogenerated files. Some of the auto-generated code needed to be fixed and edited by hand. 

All StateMod files are currently supported by StateMod-C#

## Repository Contents ##
The following folder structure is recommended for development.
Top-level folders should be created as necessary.
The following folder structure clearly separates user files (as per operating system),
development area (`cdss-dev`), product (`StateMod-Python`), repositories for product (`git-repos`),
and specific repositories for the product.
Repository folder names should agree with GitHub repository names.
Scripts in repository folders that process data should detect their starting location
and then locate other folders based on the following convention.
